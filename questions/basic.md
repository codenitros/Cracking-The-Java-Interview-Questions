## 1. what-are-the-4-important-oops-concepts?

4 important OOPs concepts include:
+ **Inheritance**
    + Inheritance is the process of defining a parent child relationship between classes. So that the code defined in the parent class can be re-used. The parent class is known as the Super class whereas the child class is known as a sub class.
    Inheritance is only applicable to the public and protected members only. Private members canâ€™t be inherited. Java does not allow multiple inheritance through classes but it is achievable using inheritance.
+ **Encapsulation**
    + Encapsulation refers to the process of binding data and methods within a class. The idea is to use the access control modifiers(public, private, protected) to show only the essential details of the class.
+ **Polymorphism**
    + Polimorphism is the process by which an object or fucntion takes different forms. Poly means many and Morph means forms.
    Polymorphism has two types:

       1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
       2. Run Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

+ **Abstraction**
    + Abstraction in object-oriented programming means hiding implementation details but to expose only 
    essential functionality and behavior with respect to context.
